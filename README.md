# Anova-and-Graphing-in-Python
Python script that runs an ANOVA on a set of fabricated data and then produces a graph. 

I made this project as a way to teach myself how to perform ANOVA testing in Python, as well as to become more familiar with the
avaiable ways to alter/dictate plots. The sample data is pulled from the text book: "Intoductory Biological Statistics" by 
Hampton and Havel and comes from a random excersise in the eleventh chapter. The data was copied to a CSV file and then imported into
the script. The file outputs the ANOVA results, tests for normality, tests for homogeneity of variances, and post-hoc tests. Additionally,
a two graphs are produced, one of which follows Tufte principles.
